//! Static notes about spec-defined line-body semantics that commonly surprise
//! recipe authors. A bare line target selects the line body without its
//! terminator (spec/language.md §3), and `after` inserts at the end of the
//! selection (§7). Notes never change meaning and never refuse; the CLI prints
//! them on stderr so stdout stays machine-clean.
