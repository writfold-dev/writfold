# Axiom audit (docs/writfold/aeneas.md)

Every theorem under `Writfold.Core` is audited: its transitive axioms must
be a subset of Lean's standard three. Anything else — `sorryAx`, a project
axiom, an Aeneas `axiom` standing in for an unmodelled external — fails the
build. The headline claims are also required to exist, so a deleted or
renamed theorem cannot pass silently.
